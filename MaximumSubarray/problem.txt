Execution Time
3 sec(C/C++) / 5 sec(JAVA) for 20 cases combined
Memory
Maximum 256MB available for heap and stack combined (note: Maximum 1 MB can be used for stack)

You are given an array A[1…N] of length N. Write a program that finds the largest sum of contiguous subarray . (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ N) 

[Input]
The first line contains a single integer Tㅡthe number of total test cases. (T ≤ 20)
The first line of each test case contains N. (N ≤ 200,000)
Each line of the following N lines contains A[i] in order. (|A[i]| ≤1,000)

[Output]
For each test case, on a single line, print the number of test case “#(TC) “and the maximum value of the corresponding test case.
Input Example
2          //Number of total test case
1          //N value (N=1)
3          //Array value (A[1] = 3)
5          //N value (N=5)
1 3 -5 3 6  //Array value (A[1] A[2] A[3] A[4] A[5]
Output Example
#1 3   //1st TC output value
#2 9
